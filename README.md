# Homework-4-CodingQuiz

This project had us coding a basic javascript quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Most of this website uses Javascript with HTML being used for the skeleton and CSS for basic Styling. Used a lot of jquery to quickly pull elements from HTML and to efficiently create dynamic elements for the website.
